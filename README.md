# Apparatus System Harness (ASH) ⚙️

> **"Orchestration is the difference between a collection of parts and a machine. ASH is the machine."**

The **Apparatus System Harness (ASH)** is the high-fidelity **Execution Pillar** of the Wadelabs ecosystem. It serves as the deterministic "Operating System" that coordinates the analytical filtering of **Scientific-Method**, the forensic verification of **The Crucible**, and the epistemological mapping of **Negative Space**.

## 🏛️ The Architecture: Deterministic Actuation
ASH is designed for high-stakes environments where "guessing" is a failure mode. It ensures that every action taken by an AI agent is preceded by a multi-stage honesty audit.

### 🧠 Core Substrate Pillars
1. **The Orchestrator**: The central nervous system. It routes every query through the Truth Substrate before allowing execution.
2. **Safe-Mode Actuators**: High-fidelity interfaces that prevent "hallucinated actuation"—ensuring the agent only interacts with external systems within verified bounds.
3. **Telemetry & Audit**: Real-time provenance tracking for every decision made by the ASH core.

## ⚙️ Components
- **`src/orchestrator.py`**: Multi-pillar coordination logic.
- **`src/actuator.py`**: Safety-critical system interaction.
- **`src/audit.py`**: Deterministic decision logging.

## 🚀 The Role in Phase 3
ASH provides the "Body" to the SMF's "Mind." It is the implementation layer that translates verified hypotheses into safe, real-world actions.
