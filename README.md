## 🏛️ Grounding: The Cold-Chain Integrity Problem
Global pharmaceutical logistics suffer from "Invisible Failures"—micro-fluctuations in temperature or humidity that compromise vaccine efficacy without triggering simple threshold alarms. Current tracking systems are centralized silos that lack real-time arbitration and fault tolerance.

**Inquisitor solves this by orchestrating a distributed, multi-instrument inquiry protocol that eliminates the possibility of unverified state transitions.**

## 🚀 7-Layer Complexity Architecture

1.  **HA Conductor (Raft)**: (Layer 1) Distributed leader election ensuring that supply chain monitoring persists even if 49% of the monitoring nodes fail.
2.  **Holonic gRPC Instruments**: (Layer 2) Modular probe system allowing rapid deployment of new sensor protocols (Thermal, RFID, Blockchain) without downtime.
3.  **Hermeneutic Synthesis Engine**: (Layer 3) Advanced arbitration logic that resolves conflicting data from diverse sensors to find the "Ground Truth".
4.  **Apophatic Falsification Engine**: (Layer 4) Eliminates data corruption by rigorously excluding any findings that violate physical or logistical axioms.
5.  **Multi-Tenant Manifest Gating**: (Layer 5) RBAC-secured inquiry cycles allowing WHO, Manufacturers, and Carriers to collaborate on a single verifiable timeline.
6.  **Quantum State Simulation**: (Layer 6) Probabilistic state tracking for intermittent sensors, preventing "False Positives" in compliance reporting.
7.  **Substrate Sandboxing**: (Layer 7) Isolated execution of unverified probes to protect the core monitoring infrastructure from hostile sensor exploits.

## 🛠️ Performance & Resilience
- **Fault-Tolerant Persistence**: All inquiry manifests are replicated across the Raft cluster.
- **Sanitized Probes**: Every instrument runs in a sandboxed environment.
- **Arbitrated Truth**: No single sensor can compromise the integrity of the whole system.
