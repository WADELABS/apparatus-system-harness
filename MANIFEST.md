# The Inquisitor Framework: An Epistemology of Automated Inquiry

## 1. Core Philosophy: Manifest-Over-Code

The Inquisitor Framework rejects the notion of "hard-coded" logic in favor of executable specifications. In this system:

- **Truth is Declarative**: The `MANIFEST` is the single source of truth. It describes **what** must be known, not **how** it is found.
- **Process becomes Provenance**: Every execution of a manifest generates an immutable record of its own operation. We do not just get answers; we get the history of the question.
- **Instruments are Transient**: Tools come and go. The `Instrument` abstraction ensures that the underlying mechanism can be swapped without invalidating the inquiry itself.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

This framework draws upon:

- **Hermeneutic Stratification**: Implementing layers of interpretation, allowing conflicting narratives to coexist and be synthesized.
- **Quantum Reasoning**: Treating hypotheses as superposed states until collapsed by observation or evidence.
- **Apophatic Methodology**: Defining truth by what is rigorously excluded or falsified.

## 3. The Protocol

The `Inquisitor` operates through a strict protocol:

1.  **Submission**: A `Manifest` is submitted, defining the scope of inquiry.
2.  **Compilation**: Valid manifests are compiled into an `ExecutionPlan`.
3.  **Conducting**: The `Conductor` orchestrates the execution, managing resources and fault tolerance.
4.  **Observation**: `Instruments` probe the `Substrate` (data sources) and return raw readings.
5.  **Synthesis**: Data is analyzed, visualized, and compiled into `Findings`.
6.  **Registry**: Findings are cryptographically hashed and stored in the `ArtifactRegistry`.

## 4. Operational Mandates

- **Self-Documentation**: The system must describe itself.
- **Total Recall**: No execution is ever lost. All provenances are preserved.
- **Adversarial Resilience**: The system assumes the environment is hostile and data is corrupted.
