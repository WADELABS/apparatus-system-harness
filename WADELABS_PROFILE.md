# Wadelabs Project Overview

This repository provides an overview of the Wadelabs software ecosystem. These projects focus on data verification, automated system management, and local utility tools.

## Core Projects

The ecosystem consists of six interrelated repositories designed to work together through standardized APIs.

### 1. [Scientific-Method-Framework](https://github.com/WADELABS/scientific-method-framework)
- **Function**: Data verification.
- **Description**: Tools for cross-referencing information against empirical sources to detect inaccuracies in automated data processing.

### 2. [Negative-Space](https://github.com/WADELABS/negative-space)
- **Function**: Data gap analysis.
- **Description**: Analyzes datasets to identify missing information or logical inconsistencies that require further investigation.

### 3. [The-Crucible](https://github.com/WADELABS/the-crucible)
- **Function**: Stress testing.
- **Description**: A framework for testing the limits of material claims and software logic through simulated failure scenarios.

### 4. [Apparatus-System-Harness (ASH)](https://github.com/WADELABS/apparatus-system-harness)
- **Function**: System Orchestration.
- **Description**: A management layer that coordinates data flow and automated tasks across the other projects.

### 5. [CredStack](https://github.com/WADELABS/credit-worthy)
- **Function**: Financial utility.
