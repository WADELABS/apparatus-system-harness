# WADELABS_MANIFESTO.md: The Cognitive Stack 🛡️🌌⚙️🏦🧼

## 🏛️ The Architecture of Autonomy
The Wadelabs ecosystem is not a collection of tools; it is a **Cognitive Stack**. Every pillar serves a specific epistemological or execution function, working in concert to bridge the gap between "hallucinated intuition" and "verified reality."

### 🔄 The Cognitive Circuit
When the substrate receives an inquiry (e.g., from `inbox-sanitizer` or `credstack`), it moves through the following gauntlet:

1.  **[Negative-Space](file:///C:/Users/sheew/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/negative-space)**: **Sense-Making Layer**. Identifies the "Void" (what data is missing, what causal links are broken).
2.  **[Scientific-Method-Framework](file:///C:/Users/sheew/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/scientific-method)**: **Truth Layer**. Forms a hypothesis based on the void and performs empirical research to find real-world groundings.
3.  **[Apparatus-System-Harness](file:///C:/Users/sheew/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/apparatus-system-harness)**: **Execution Substrate**. Orchestrates the inquiry and acts as the "Fixer" to resolve the failure at its actual layer.
4.  **[The-Crucible](file:///C:/Users/sheew/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/the-crucible)**: **Verification Layer**. Stress-tests the results to ensure they aren't "hallucinated value" or "IKEA-with-a-story."

## 🛰️ WADELABS_API: Standardized Interface
All components communicate via the `WADELABS_API`, ensuring telemetry and command signals are high-fidelity and audit-ready.

-   **Signals**: `VOID_DETECTED`, `HYPOTHESIS_FORMED`, `AUDIT_TRIGGERED`, `VERACITY_CONFIRMED`.
-   **Philosophy**: Manifest-Over-Code. Explicit over Implicit. Zero Hallucination.
