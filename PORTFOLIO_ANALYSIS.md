# Portfolio Analysis: Inquisitor (Market Feed Integrity)

## 🎯 The Problem: Fragmented & Tainted Market Feeds
Trading pods often rely on single-source APIs or fragmented feeds that can be manipulated or fail during high-volatility events. Traditional data loaders lack **Consensus Logic**—they trust whatever data arrives first.

## 🛠️ The Solution: The Inquisitor Conductor (AFRRC Tier 2)
The Inquisitor treats Market Data as a **distributed trust problem**. By using **Raft Consensus (Layer 1)**, it ensures that even if three exchanges go down or provide "trash" pricing, the system holds a stable, replicated state of the market. Its **Apophatic Engine (Layer 4)** automatically falsifies pricing data that violates fundamental law (e.g., bid/ask spreads that indicate a broken market).

## 📈 Outcome: High-Fidelity Financial Oracles
The result is a data substrate that is immune to single-node failures and "Oracle Attacks." It provides the Quant Desk with a "Single Source of Truth" that has been verified across 7 layers of technical rigor.

## 💎 The Edge: Why This Beats Current Solutions
| Feature | Traditional Market Feed | WADELABS Inquisitor (AFRRC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Availability** | SPoF (Single Point of Failure) | Distributed Raft Consensus |
| **Validation** | Range-checks only | Apophatic Logic (Exclusion of Contradiction) |
| **Security** | Open access | Gated RBAC Manifests |
| **Integrity** | Raw Data | Synthesized "Hermeneutic" Truth |
| **Resilience** | Brittle | Quantum-Inspired State Simulation |

### The "Oracle Armor"
In a world of "Flash Loans" and "Price Manipulation," the Inquisitor acts as an **Oracle Armor**, ensuring that the trading engine only ever sees verified, high-consensus truth.
